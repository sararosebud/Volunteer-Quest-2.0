## Installation
<a name="installation"></a>
In a local environment, after cloning this repository, run npm start in the command line. Or visit [this site](LINK TO HEROKU) to checkout the app from a web browser.

## Usage
<a name="usage"></a>
When a user visits the site, they will be presented with a homepage that displays a carousel of current events happening that they can click on and sign up for, also links to non profit orginizations and other related info, also all events can be seen in list form through the navbar button. When the user presses the login button, they are prompted to sign up or log in to their account. If an event organizer, they have the option to click the checkbox at sign up to give them access to event creation in their profile page, and deletion of said events. All users are able to update their profile info, subscribe/unsubscribe to events. Users can leave comments on events to create a feel of community while they find events to sign up for.

## Future Development
<a name="fd"></a>
We would like to flesh out the social aspect of the app if work was continued. Having user profile pages being displayed to other users with subscribed events, completed events, and a profile picture. Also integration of location, asking the organizer what zip code the event will take place or exact coordinates, and integrating a geolocation API and Google's Map API to help the user find events near them in a filtered list or visually.
