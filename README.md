## Future Development
<a name="fd"></a>
We would like to flesh out the social aspect of the app if work was continued. Having user profile pages being displayed to other users with subscribed events, completed events, and a profile picture. Also integration of location, asking the organizer what zip code the event will take place or exact coordinates, and integrating a geolocation API and Google's Map API to help the user find events near them in a filtered list or visually.
